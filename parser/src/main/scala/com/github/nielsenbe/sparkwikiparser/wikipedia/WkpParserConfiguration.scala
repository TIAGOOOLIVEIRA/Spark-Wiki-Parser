/** Settings for telling the parser which elements to parse
  *
  * @param parseText text can be turned off without impacting other elements
  * @param parseTemplates turning off templates will remove the ability to identify a sections main article
  *                       it will also cause some disambiguation pages to be labeled as articles
  * @param parseLinks turning off links will cause some errors in the text since links are often used as part of the text
  * @param parseTags turning off tags will cause many reference citations to disappear
  * @param parseTables tables can be turned off without impacting other elements
  * @param parseRefTags The Sweble parser does not extract reference templates from within < ref > tags
  *                     This means we need to re-parse the inner text.  This is a slow operation and can increase total parse time
  *                     by 0-100%.  If reference templates are not needed then it is recommended that his option be turned off
